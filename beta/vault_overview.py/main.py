"""
## Description
This script generates an overview file (overview.md) in the root directory of the vault,
listing all folders, subfolders, and notes in a hierarchical structure. It also includes
the number of characters in each note.

It creates a Markdown file with the following sections:
- Vault Overview: A hierarchical list of all folders, subfolders, and notes with character count.

The script reads the notes from a directory that is organized by folders and subfolders.

## Notes
- The script expects the notes to be in Markdown format (.md).
- The script skips the '.obsidian' and '.trash' folders.

## Changelog
- Version 1.0
  - 2025-01-12: Initial version
- Version 1.1
  - 2025-01-12: Added character count for each note.
